<li><strong> INFORMATION USE</strong></li>

<p>ON7 uses the information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide information for a certain reason, we may use that information in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the information you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem.

ON7 and its Related Companies may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. ON7 may also use your information in other ways, with your consent or as disclosed to you at the time of collection.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> INFORMATION DISCLOSURE</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>ON7 is not in the business of selling your personal information. We consider personal information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your information with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rewards Providers</strong>: To the extent you have obtained or redeemed a reward offered by a Rewards Provider, added a Rewards Provider as a membership to your account, made a purchase at or through a Rewards Provider, or otherwise participated in any other activity sponsored or offered on behalf of the Rewards Provider, we may provide your information to such Rewards Providers (a) for the Rewards Provider to redeem and validate your reward, send you customized offers, troubleshoot redemption, combat fraud and otherwise communicate with you; (b) as part of legal proceedings affecting ON7 or the Rewards Provider; or (c) to send you marketing information or otherwise facilitate a direct relationship between the Rewards Provider and you.</li>
<li><strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties</strong>: ON7, like many businesses, sometimes hires agents or service providers to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include maintaining databases, sending emails and SMS messages, offering and developing certain features of the Services, and performing maintenance and security. When we employ an agent or service provider to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function. We also disclose automatically collected data (card scans, promotional activities, and redemption information) to our Rewards Providers, third-party ad servers, and third-party advertisers. These third parties may match this data with information that they have previously collected about you under their own privacy policies.</li>
<li><strong>Your Public Profile</strong>: If you make any information available through your public profile, it will be made available to members of the ON7 community. Please note that your first name and last initial and photo are, by default, available on your public profile, while your phone number, email, and birthday are kept nonpublic (consistent with this Privacy Policy). Please exercise caution when disclosing personal information in these public areas of the Services.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Requirements</strong>: ON7 may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation or assist government enforcement agencies, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of ON7, Rewards Providers, or our users, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, (iv) protect against legal liability; (v) protect Rewards Providers from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; or (vi) protect the security or integrity of the Services.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>YOUR CHOICES AND OPT-OUTS</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We do not share your personal information with other third-party organizations for their marketing or promotional uses without your consent except as part of a specific program or feature for which we will provide the ability to opt out. The Services will automatically send you SMS messages with updates and other information. You may stop receiving SMS messages by replying STOP or OFF in response to any received SMS message. You may also opt-out of receiving SMS messages on the ON7 website. If you opt-out of receiving SMS messages, you may not be able to use certain Services. If you do not want to receive marketing emails from us, click the unsubscribe link in the footer of such emails.</p>

The Services may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by ON7 (the “<strong><em>Third-Party Sites</em></strong>”).

<li><strong> SECURITY</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>ON7 takes reasonable steps to protect the information provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
